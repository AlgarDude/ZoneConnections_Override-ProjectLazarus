# [**THIS FILE IS A RESOURCE ON REDGUIDES.COM!**](https://www.redguides.com/community/resources/project-lazarus-mq2easyfind-override-compatible-with-default-zoneconnections-file.3235/)

This file enables custom Project Lazarus zoning options without overwriting the default ZoneConnections.yaml file.  
  
Examples:
* Valium  
* Klonopin  
* Alaria (in PoK)  
* Correct PoK stone locations  
* Custom connections to the Bazaar (Celli, et al)  
  
This are plenty of things that could be added, but we can grow it over time together! I plan on uploading this to a github site and allowing PRs and additions in the near future. Until that time (and even afterwards), if you have something to contribute, feel free to post in the discussion.  
  
This resource is a mix of my personal efforts and some data that has been copied from various "emu" and "Laz" zone connection files that have been passed around over the years in various discords. As I cannot give specific credit, I wish a special thank you to anyone who has previously contributed to such!  
  
## INSTRUCTIONS:  
Place the downloaded file in your (MQInstall)\resources\EasyFind directory.  
The override will automatically pull the updated connections the next time you zone into any zone included in the file.  
  
## FAQ:  
How does all of this work?  
Some time ago, some kind souls [added the ability to use an override file](https://github.com/brainiac/MQ2EasyFind/commit/a0cbedf67a08c3f4fe127e19438a880e91a70145) to allow custom connections without touching your default ZoneConnection file. 
Any zones listed in the override will fully replace any and all connections in the default ZoneConnections.yaml (thus, the term override).
